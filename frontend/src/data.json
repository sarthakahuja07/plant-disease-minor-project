    "Tomato___Early_blight": {
        "type": "tomoato plant",
        "diseases": "Early blight",
        "symptoms": "Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a “bull’s eye” pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.Early blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85˚F.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.",
        "prevention": "Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry. For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.SERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.Burn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost."

    "Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot": {
        "type": "pepper bell plant",
        "diseases": "Bacterial spot",
        "symptoms": "Disease symptoms can appear throughout the above-ground portion of the plant, which may include leaf spot, fruit spot and stem canker. However, early symptoms show up as water-soaked lesions on leaves  that can quickly change from green to dark brown and enlarge into spots that are up to 1/4 inch in diameter with slightly raised margins. Over time, these spots can dry up in less humid weather, which allows the damaged tissues to fall off, resulting in a tattered appearance on the affected leaves.The size of the lesions can be quite variable with irregular and somewhat angular margins. On some cultivars, leaves may display several small lesions – 1/4 to 1/2 centimeter – covering over 80% of the leaf’s area, whereas on others, fewer large lesions – larger than 1/2 centimeter – may be visible. In some cases, a combination of small and large lesions may be found on the leaves. Yield can be drastically reduced as affected leaves turn yellow and drop off prematurely, thus reducing plant productivity and exposing fruit to potential sunscald. In addition, raised, scab-like spots on fruit render the fruit unmarketable. Although a bacterial infection does not cause direct rot of fruit, lesions can provide an entrance for other fruit-rotting pathogens, resulting in fruit decay.",
        "prevention": "Control of bacterial spot on greenhouse transplants is an essential step for preventing the spread of the leaf spot bacteria in the field. Transplants should be inspected regularly to identify symptomatic seedlings. Transplants with symptoms may be removed and destroyed or treated with streptomycin, if detected at the very early stage of disease development. It should be noted that strains of leaf spot bacteria resistant to streptomycin may arise with multiple applications of streptomycin. Copper sprays can be used to control bacterial leaf spot, but they are not as effective when used alone on a continuous basis. Thus, combining these sprays with a plant resistance inducer, such as Regalia or Actigard, can provide good protection from the disease. Labeled rates of fixed copper is combined with different rates of Actigard, depending on the growth stage of plants. Higher rates (1 ounce per 100 gallons) of Actigard is used early in the season at transplant, 1/2 ounce is used two weeks later and 1/3 ounce is recommended for subsequent sprays as needed. Two other products, Penncozeb and Quintec were also found effective in some studies. However, organic growers should use copper and Regalia combination instead of copper and Actigard. Apply on a seven- to 10-day schedule; use the shorter interval when rain, high humidity and warm temperatures occur and the longer in case of dry weather.Beneficial microorganisms containing products, such as Serenade and Sonata, can reduce pepper leaf spot if used proactively. However, once the disease has spread to more than 5% of plants, these products can’t suppress the disease.Infested crop debris and infected weeds are additional sources of the pathogen and must be managed in an effective BLS control program. It is important to control nightshade, horsenettle, jimsonweed and all other solanaceous weeds from current and future pepper fields. Breakdown of crop residue can be hastened by disking or plowing field immediately after the final harvest.Crop rotation should be used to avoid pathogen carryover on volunteers and crop residue. Avoid fields that have been planted with peppers or tomatoes especially if they had bacterial spot. In the field use at least a three-year rotation because the pathogen can survive in infested crop debris until it completely decomposes. Do not rotate pepper with tomato eggplant or potato and do not grow these crops together.In the greenhouse discard trays adjacent to outbreak location to minimize disease spread. Always start with new or disinfected greenhouse supplies and materials when planting peppers. Trays benches tools and greenhouse structures should be washed and sanitized between seedling crops. Good cultural practices include avoiding all conditions that enable the pathogen to spread and multiply rapidly. Bacteria spread with splashing water. Therefore, overhead irrigation method should be replaced with drip irrigation and the field should not be accessed when plants are wet"

        "type": "strawberry plant",
        "diseases": "Leaf scorch",
        "symptoms": "Scorched strawberry leaves are caused by a fungal infection which affects the foliage of strawberry plantings. The fungus responsible is called Diplocarpon earliana. Strawberries with leaf scorch may first show signs of issue with the development of small purplish blemishes that occur on the topside of leaves. Over time, the spots will continue to grow larger and darken. In severe cases, dark spots may even cover entire portions of strawberry plant leaves and cause them to completely dry and fall from the plant. Though the foliage of the infected plants is not aesthetically pleasing, it is seldom that the presence of this fungus impacts the quality of the strawberry crop itselfRead more at Gardening Know How: Strawberries With Leaf Scorch – Treating Strawberry Leaf Scorch Symptoms https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/fruits/strawberry/strawberries-with-leaf-scorch.htm",
        "prevention": "While leaf scorch on strawberry plants can be frustrating, there are some strategies which home gardeners may employ to help prevent its spread in the garden. The primary means of strawberry leaf scorch control should always be prevention. Since this fungal pathogen overwinters on the fallen leaves of infected plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection. When making new plantings always ensure that good planting practices are implemented. These practices include the use of proper plant spacing to provide adequate air circulation and the use of drip irrigation. The avoidance of waterlogged soil and frequent garden cleanup will help to reduce the likelihood of spread of this fungus.

        "type": "apple tree",
        "diseases": "Apple scab",
        "symptoms": "If infected leaf litter gets wet in spring, spores are released and may be carried by wind or rain to infect new leaf and blossom tissue. However, spores can continue to infect throughout the season as long as temperature and humidity conditions are favorable. Symptoms include: Olive-green to black velvety spots with indistinct margins on leaves. Severe cases can lead to yellowing of the leaves and early defoliation. Olive-green to black lesions on the fruit turn brown and corky over time.",
        "prevention": " Remove and destroy the fallen leaf litter so that the fungus cannot overwinter. This may reduce the disease pressure in the following spring, but will not likely eliminate the disease.Do not overcrowd plants, and make sure the canopy has proper airflow. This will decrease the conditions favorable for disease development.Fungicide applications at 2-week intervals beginning when new growth is expanding in the spring.Crabapple cultivars that are resistant to apple scab are widely available"

        "prevention": "Tomato varieties resistant to certain races of the late blight fungus are grown where the disease occurs regularly.   Remove any nearby volunteer tomato and potato plants and nightshades.     Check transplants to ensure they are free of late blight before planting.    Avoid sprinkler irrigation, if possible, because it favors the development of late blight.     Fungicides are generally needed only if the disease appears during a time of year when rain is likely or overhead irrigation is practiced. Mefenoxam-resistant strains of the pathogen are widespread in California and this fungicide is no longer effective.       Disc tomato fields in fall to eliminate a winter reservoir for the fungus"

    "Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles)": {
        "type": "grape plant",
        "diseases": "Black measles",
        "symptoms": "Vine decline symptoms, caused by any of these pathogens, are indistinguishable and develop slowly in the first few seasons of vineyard establishment and production. Young vines generally appear normal at planting, but differences in vigor become marked: reduced caliper size of the trunk, shortened internodes, reduced foliage, and reduced leaf size. The first 3 to 5 years after planting, onset of foliar symptoms may appear as interveinal chlorosis, followed by necrosis and early defoliation. Wilting and shoot tip dieback may also occur. Uneven wood maturity, usually associated with rapid desiccation, is another common symptom. In older vines, affected leaves show a characteristic and severe interveinal chlorosis and necrosis, sometimes referred to as a 'tiger stripe' pattern. Apolexy refers to the sudden appearance of symptoms and collapse of vines. This is generally seen only mid-season in areas with high summer temperatures. Berries may show purple or brown spotting on the skin.",
        "prevention": "Chemical control Chemical strategies to control these pathogens are difficult, as traditional techniques used for the control of surface pathogens do not penetrate dormant grapevine cuttings sufficiently to control fungi inhabiting the vascular system. Soaking infected dormant cuttings or vines in fungicides before grafting or planting has reduced disease incidence and severity but none are registered for this use. Biological control Use in conjunction with cultural control tactics such as thorough sanitation. Trichoderma sp. have been shown to help protect pruning wounds, basal ends of propagation material, and graft unions before infection. Use within 24 hours of pruning and again in 2 weeks"
